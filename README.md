Sentiment analysis using a neural network.
Transformed text data into numerical feature vectors using TF-IDF, then constructed and trained a traditional feedforward neural network using these vectors as inputs. 
Analyzed  neural network model's performance on the test data to its performance on the training data to determine whether model is overfitting the training data.
Also improved the neural network model's ability to generalize to new, previously unseen data aand experimented with with different neural network configurations 
to observe the effect this has on the model's overall performance.
